Build with clear plate 3mm thickness. If you experience that switches get pushed out from the plate some felt pads can help keep the distance between PCB and Plate.

Felt pads are not visible with keycaps. If you dont want them visible at all, you might opt for an opaque palte.

Half clear and half opaque case can give a nice effect with the underglow
